        <p>JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else.
            (Okay, not everything, but it is amazing what you can achieve with a few lines of JavaScript code.)</p>

        <p>What Is HTML Used For? Hypertext Markup Language, or HTML, is a programming language used to describe the structure of web pages. HTML makes it possible to create

        <h1>CSS</h1>
        <p>Instead, it's a language used to style HTML elements. CSS is responsible for the text style, size, positioning, color, and more on a website. It's also what
            controls how a website's style shifts between desktop and mobile versions.</p>
